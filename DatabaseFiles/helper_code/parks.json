Managed as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, this Affiliated Area of the National Park Service also includes the remnants of a military fortification and the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast. Alcatraz has a layered history—once home to Civil War-era military prisoners, it later became a symbol of Native American resistance during the 1969-1971 occupation by activists calling for Indigenous rights.\nToday, visitors can explore the island's preserved prison buildings, historic gardens, and stunning bay views while learning about its multifaceted past through exhibits and ranger-led tours. Alcatraz is accessible only by ferry, and it remains one of the most popular cultural and historical attractions in the United States.",

The monument is unserviced—no campground or potable water—so travelers must be self-reliant, but they’re rewarded with ranger-led programs, verdant spring wildflower displays, backcountry skiing and snowshoeing in winter, and abundant wildlife viewing.

The site is fully ADA-accessible in key areas—including the parade ground, museum exhibits, and shuttle drop-off—and offers vault toilets, a small bookstore, and street-side parking (no potable water or camping). From its brick ramparts you’ll enjoy unobstructed views of the bridge and San Francisco Bay, and along the shoreline, coastal seabirds find roosts amid the rocky promontory.

Visitors can hike more than 190 miles of trails, camp under internationally recognized dark skies at nine developed campgrounds, and explore cultural sites once occupied by Cahuilla and Serrano peoples. Wildlife includes bighorn sheep, coyotes, desert tortoises, and an array of reptiles and birds. With minimal services in its backcountry and a focus on self-sufficiency, Joshua Tree offers solitude, iconic scenery, and a profound sense of desert wilderness just a short drive from the Palm Springs and Coachella Valley communities.",

Visitors can paddle Manzanita Lake beneath a perfect volcanic reflection, soak in the historic Drakesbad Guest Ranch hot springs, or snowshoe across silent winter snowscapes.

        "park_description": "Lava Beds National Monument, established in 1925 on the northeastern flank of Medicine Lake Volcano, preserves North America’s densest concentration of lava-tube caves and a stark high-desert landscape steeped in Modoc War history. Visitors begin at the accessible Visitor Center—home to touch exhibits, a bookstore, and park films—then explore over a dozen marked surface trails that circle collapsed tube trenches, spatter cones, and the Petroglyph Point pictograph panels. The Indian Well Campground offers basic tent and RV sites just a half-mile from the cave loop. Adventurers can join ranger-led tours into illuminated caves like Mushpot, self-guide across rugged lava flows, backcountry camp under the stars, or birdwatch desert scrub habitats. With no cabins or showers, no fishing or hunting, and a strict drone ban, Lava Beds delivers an immersive, self-sufficient experience in volcanic geology, Native American heritage, and subterranean wonder.",

Trail lovers can stroll under cathedral-like trunks, wander through Fern Canyon’s verdant walls, or explore tidepool-rich beaches. Campers have options ranging from developed campsites and ADA cabins to remote backcountry sites along rivers or shorelines. Wildlife thrives here—from Roosevelt elk and salmon to banana slugs and migrating whales offshore. With five visitor centers, accessible infrastructure (including beach wheelchairs), ranger-guided programs, and strict protections against drones and hunting, the parks offer both awe-inspiring adventure and quiet reflection in one of America’s most iconic forest ecosystems.",

        "park_description": "Tule Lake National Monument commemorates the site of one of the ten WWII Japanese American incarceration camps—Tule Lake Segregation Center—where up to 18,700 Japanese Americans were forcibly held from 1942 to 1946. Located near the California–Oregon border, the monument preserves a range of camp structures and landscapes: the Cellhouse where the dissenters were detained, Block 6/7 gardens where families tried to maintain normalcy, and the cemetery and memorial groves honoring those who died here. The Visitor Center, co-located in the former Fairgrounds, offers exhibits, artifacts, and ranger-led programs that delve into resistance, loyalty questions, and camp life. No camping or recreational amenities exist; the focus is exclusively on education, reflection, and remembrance. Visitors are invited to walk shallow trails past original foundations and interpretive signs, listen to survivor stories, and acknowledge one of the most challenging chapters in American civil liberties history.",
